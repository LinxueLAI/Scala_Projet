# SCALA BASIC LEARNING

## LESSONS
### LESSON 1

For this lesson, you need to import this project with IntelliJ
and try to run the two classes in the Lesson1 package.
This first lesson shows how to create a
runnable Application. There is two ways to do it:
 
  * with the 'main' method. You will explore it in the Lesson1_a class.
  * with the 'App' extension. You will explore it in the Lesson1_b class.
 
The first solution has to be preferred, because the
second one is sometimes complex to maintain when you have a long
code with lot of fields and functions. In this case, 
it is difficult to see which part of the code is run.
It is easier when you can target it with the main method approach.


### LESSON 2
This lesson shows the basic scala types
and how to initialize them, implicitly or explicitly.

We will also see the difference between 
non final variable ('var') and final variable ('val').

Thus, we will list and see how use some basic scala types: 
String, Char, Int, Long, Float, Double, List, Array, Set, Map



### LESSON 3
This lesson shows how to use the syntax to use 
the following operators:
*if
*for
*while
*do
*try/catch/finally


### LESSON 4
This lesson shows how to instantiate all the 
scala kinds of object and explains what are 
their purposes:
* Class
* Case class
* Object
* Abstract Class
* Trait

In addition, private, public, protected, lazy



### LESSON 5 
This lesson shows more advanced concept about
* Lesson a : Sequences and sequence manipulation
* Lesson b : Tuples and Tuple manipulation
* Lesson c : Maps and Map manipulation
* Lesson d : Sets and Set manipulation
### LESSON 6 
This lesson explains the concept of Option by
the Scala Regex engine. 

### LESSON 7 
This lesson shows how to do some basics operation
on files and how to serialize easy some scala classes.
File
Serialization
CSV


### LESSON 8
This lesson explains some basic concept about 
parallelization and how to use Futures in scala
